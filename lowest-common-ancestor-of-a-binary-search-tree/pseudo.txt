problem: find the least common ancestor between two given nodes
constraints: the numer of nodes in the tree is in the range [2,5^10]
-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
all Node.val are unique
p!=q
p and q will exist in the BST
base case: if root null return null
edge case: if root is equal to q or root is equal to p return root; nodes can be lca themselves
pseudocode:
if root is null return null
if root is p or q return null
if p.val < root->val and q.val < root.val return recursion in left subtree
else if p.val and q.val > root.val return recursion in right subtree
else return root
